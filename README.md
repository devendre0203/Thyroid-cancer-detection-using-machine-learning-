Thyroid Detection Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for detecting thyroid disease using various classification algorithms. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to accurately classify individuals as having thyroid disease or not, based on medical data.
The key objectives of this project are:

To preprocess and analyze the thyroid dataset.
To implement various machine learning models.
To evaluate the performance of each model and select the best one.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical records related to thyroid function. It includes features like age, sex, TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone), T3, T4U, and others, which are commonly used to assess thyroid health.
